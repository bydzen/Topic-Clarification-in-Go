# Topic Clarification in GoLang (ID: Dasar Algoritma Pemrograman)

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This project was created to fulfill a large assignment in an algorithm and data structure course. Where is our job to make medical data that is based on multiple lists. This project is carried out by two people to complete a program.

## Getting Started

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Download Go. Binary distributions available for. Linux, macOS, Windows, and more.

### Prerequisites

Should at least be able to understand one of the Go programming languages. and little knowledge about data structures to understand this project

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

const xxx = 1000

type (
	arrs []string
	arrx [xxx]string
)
```

### Installing

For Manual installing see here: https://golang.org/doc/install

## Running the tests

### Break down into end to end tests

To compile and run a simple program, first choose a module path (we'll use example.com/user/hello) and create a go.mod file that declares it:

```bash
$ mkdir hello # Alternatively, clone it if it already exists in version control.
$ cd hello
$ go mod init example.com/user/hello
go: creating new go.mod: module example.com/user/hello
$ cat go.mod
module example.com/user/hello

go 1.14
$
```

The first statement in a Go source file must be package name. Executable commands must always use package main.

Next, create a file named hello.go inside that directory containing the following Go code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world.")
}
```

Now you can build and install that program with the go tool:

```bash
$ go install example.com/user/hello
$
```

This command builds the hello command, producing an executable binary. It then installs that binary as $HOME/go/bin/hello (or, under Windows, %USERPROFILE%\go\bin\hello.exe).
